### Data Types
Basically there are 2 data types:
- **Primitive Data Types**
  - stored directly in the location the variable accesses
  - stored on the stack
  - String, Number, Boolean, Null (intentional empty value), Undefined (variable that has not been assigned a value), Symbols (ES6)
- **Reference Data Types / Objects**
  - accessed by reference
  - objects that are store on the heap
  - pointer to a location in memory
  - Array, Object Literal, Function, Date, Anything Else...
