By using backticks `, a string template is defined.

Template literals (template strings) are enclosed by the back-tick (` `)  (grave accent) character instead of double or single quotes. Template literals can contain placeholders. These are indicated by the dollar sign and curly braces: ${expression}. The expressions in the placeholders and the text between the back-ticks gets passed to a function. The default function just concatenates the parts into a single string.
