The Date object is used to work with dates and times.

Date objects are created with new Date().

There are four ways of instantiating a date:

`const d = new Date();`
`const d = new Date(milliseconds);`
`const d = new Date(dateString);`
`const d = new Date(year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds);`
