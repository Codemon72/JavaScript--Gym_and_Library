join 2 or more strings, return new joined string

The concat() method is used to join two or more strings.

This method does not change the existing strings, but returns a new string containing the text of the joined strings.

**Note**: we rarely see the actual use of concat(), because we have a more simple way: using the + operator.

**Tip**: Probably better: the join() method.

#### Syntax

`string.concat(string1, string2, ..., stringX)` 

Parameter Values

- string1, string2, ..., stringX	- Required. The strings to be joined

**Return** Value:	A new String, containing the text of the combined strings
