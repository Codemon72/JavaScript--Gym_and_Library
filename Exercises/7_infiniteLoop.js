// Coding in function infiniteLoop. function accepts 3 parameters. The 1st parameter is arr, it's a 2D array, it contains three 1D array. The 2nd parameter is d ï¼Œit's a string. The 3rd parameter is n, it's a number.

// You can think of arr as a moat, the elements of arr like water constantly flow in. The direction of flow is controlled by the parameter d. The value of d can be "left" or "right". "left" means the "river" moves to the left. All elements in the 1D array are to the left moving n position, if beyond the bounds of the array and the element is moved to the tail on the left side of the array; if it exceeds the left boundary element would be moved to the tail of 3rd array(like a circle). Right is also similar to the operation, but it is moving to the right.

// Finally, return arr.

const infiniteLoop = (arr, d, n) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (d === "left") {
      arr[0].push(arr[1].shift());
      arr[1].push(arr[2].shift());
      arr[2].push(arr[0].shift());
    }
    if (d === "right") {
      arr[0].unshift(arr[2].pop());
      arr[2].unshift(arr[1].pop());
      arr[1].unshift(arr[0].pop());
    }
  }
  return arr;
};

// console.log(infiniteLoop( [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]],"left",1));
// expected: [[2,3,4],[5,6,7],[8,9,1]]);
// console.log(infiniteLoop([[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, 9],],"right",1));
// expected: [[9,1,2],[3,4,5],[6,7,8]]);
// console.log(infiniteLoop( [[1,2],[3,4,5,6],[7,8,9,10]],"left",2));
// expected:  [[3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,1,2]]);
